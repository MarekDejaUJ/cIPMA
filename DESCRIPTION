Description: Integrates PLS-SEM importance-performance analysis via 'seminr' with Necessary 
    Condition Analysis via 'NCA' to jointly assess sufficiency and necessity of 
    predictors in structural equation models. Provides automated indicator rescaling, 
    bottleneck computation, assumption diagnostics (reliability, HTMT, VIF), and 
    publication-ready visualization. Includes experimental support for exploratory 
    structure learning via 'bnlearn' with twelve algorithms and whitelist/blacklist 
    constraints.
